This program is my starting point in programming, the goal is to create a program that generates California Lottery numbers.
<br>The goal is to make a program with a user interface that asks the user to either generate lottery numbers or obtain results from winning lottery number and display them. The code is aimed to be used for the California Lottery, but will be written in a manner that it may accommodate to lottery results from any state.
